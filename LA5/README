## Summary
## Porting this project over to C# was challenging for me since I had limited knowledge of C# in general.
## While I could easily understand the java program, finidng the exact ways to accomplish the same tasks
## in C# was not as cut and dry. I basically had to look up each function in java and see what the 
## corresponding one was in C#, along with several google searches to understand what was analogous to Jframes.
## The java implemenation is much easier to understand, as is Java in general, in my opinion. I was briefly
## in a online program through Oregon State and they start students using C# instead of Java, and it was
## difficult even then. A helpful, though fairly old tool that was extremely helpful here, was the Java
## Language Conversion Assistant, a relic of a tool from Visual Studio 2005. It attempts to convert Java
## code to C#. It did indeed do the conversion, but would not compile, as I expected and the documentation
## said would occur. It later crashed and corrrupted when my Visual Studio 2019 updater ran, o well.
## While it wasn't perfect, it gave me a skelton of code to work with and that's how I arrived with the current 
## state of the project.
